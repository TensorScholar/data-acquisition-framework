**Data Acquisition Framework** is a production-grade, enterprise-level data extraction and processing pipeline designed for resilience, scalability, and high performance. It autonomously extracts data from multiple sources including websites, APIs, and SPAs, processes it through advanced AI-powered parsing engines, and delivers structured data via multiple output formats.

This project demonstrates modern software engineering principles through a sophisticated **Clean Architecture**, **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, **CQRS pattern**, and proactive resilience through **Chaos Engineering**.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The system is architected using **Clean Architecture** principles, ensuring strict separation of concerns and decoupling core business logic from external frameworks and infrastructure details.

### Architectural Layers

- **Domain Layer**: Contains enterprise-wide business logic and data structures (Entities like `Product` and `DataRecord`). Completely isolated with zero external dependencies.

- **Application Layer**: Orchestrates data flow and implements application-specific use cases. Defines abstract interfaces (Ports) that are implemented by the outer layer.

- **Infrastructure Layer**: Contains all implementation details. Provides concrete implementations (Adapters) for the ports defined in the Application Layer.

## üöÄ Key Features

### Multi-Source Data Extraction

1. **Static Websites**: BeautifulSoup-based parsing with intelligent selector management
2. **Dynamic SPAs**: Selenium WebDriver with advanced page object patterns
3. **REST APIs**: Intelligent retry mechanisms and rate limiting
4. **Real-time Streams**: WebSocket and Server-Sent Events support

### Multi-Layered Caching Strategy

1. **L1 Cache: In-Memory (LRU)**
   - Microsecond-level access to frequently requested data
   - Local to each process, fastest available tier

2. **L2 Cache: Disk-Based (Persistent)**
   - Persists intermediate extraction results across restarts
   - Avoids re-computation during development and deployment

3. **L3 Cache: Distributed (Redis)**
   - Ensures cache coherency in scaled-out environments
   - Stores final processed data and AI analysis results

### Proactive Resilience: Chaos Engineering

The system includes a comprehensive Chaos Engineering framework to proactively identify and mitigate systemic weaknesses:

- **Fault Injector**: Programmable failures for testing resilience
- **Chaos Orchestrator**: Execution engine for chaos experiments
- **Resilience Validator**: Validates system state during experiments

### Advanced AI-Powered Processing

- **Multi-linguistic Support**: English and Persian tokenization
- **Medical Data Classification**: Dermatology and INCI ingredient mapping
- **Intelligent Parsing**: Machine learning models for content extraction
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive business rule validation

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.x+
